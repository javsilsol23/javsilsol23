- 🔭 I am a computer engineer with over 20 years of experience in software development and IT consulting, specializing in SAP, electronic commerce, and digital signatures.
- 🌱 While I am a beginner in the world of data science, I am eager to grow my skills and knowledge in this field. Currently, I am building my portfolio of data science and machine learning projects, and I hope to share them with you soon.
- ⚡ I studied a semester abroad in the University of Oulu in Finland, very close to Santa Claus' headquarters in Rovaniemi. I have worked and lived and, as a result, hold a social security number from Spain, Italy, Germany, and Sweden, but currently I am only available for remote jobs.
